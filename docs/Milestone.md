## BTS Flight Forecast
<b> Background </b>b>
BTS Flight Forecast is a tool to predict flight delays utilizing past weather data, and weather forecast, given a specified airport code, date, and time.
<b> Data source </b>
1. Flight Data: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FGK&QO_fu146_anzr=b0-gvzr
2. Weather Data: https://www.wunderground.com/history

## Milestone 1
Data pre-processing
- Matching weather data with flight data
  - (Explore weather API for future, has anyone saved previous forecast data)
- Data years: 2022, 2023
  
## Milestone 2
Modeling
- ML (Prediction of % delay)
- Estimation of delay time
- Estimation of the type of delay
  
## Milestone 3
- Component 1 (GUI)
- Component 2 (GUI)
  
Note: PyQT can host frozen models
  
## Milestone 4
How retraining will work. (Should be easy if we use scikit learn)

Assumption: User will download data in the correct format.
