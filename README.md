## BTS Flight Forecast

BTS Flight Forecast is a tool to predict Flight delays.

Our goal is to utilize historical flight delay data along with past weather information to generate accurate predictions. 
By analysing existing datasets and integrating with weather forecast APIs, this tool assesses the likelihood of delays for a specified airport code, date, and time.
